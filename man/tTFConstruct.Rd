\title{Constrct a taxaTF object}
\usage{
tTFConstruct(BSFile = NULL, taxa = "all", tf = "all", verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{BSFile}{a text file contains raw TF binding score values.
Row names correspond with gene names,
and colum names correspond with species and trasncription factor names.}

\item{taxa}{one single string or a vector of strings specifying main taxa, such like species
or celll line types, selected for constructing \code{taxaTF} object.
If one single string "all" is given,
all the taxa in the row names will be matched and selected ("all" by default).}

\item{tf}{one single string or a vector of strings sepcifying transcription factor(s) selected for
constructing \code{taxaTF} object.
If one single string "all" is given,
all the transcription factor(s) in the row names will be matched and selected ("all" by default).}

\item{verbose}{a logical specifying whether to print more information on the screen
while constructing \code{taxaTF} objects (FALSE by default).}
}
\value{
returns an object of class \code{TaxaTF} (S3 class, a list of \code{taxonTF} objects).
}
\description{
\code{TFconstruct} is a constructor function for \code{taxaTF} objects.
This fuction takes in a binding score file
and constructs a \code{taxaTF} object from which user can extract information
for display or for further analysis.
}
\examples{

taxa.objects = TFconstruct(BSFile = system.file('extdata/CEBPA_meanIntensity_all_Mouse.txt', package = 'AnceTran'),
   taxa = "all", tf = "all", verbose = FALSE)

}
